## Data Analysis Process 

The data analysis process typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Problem Definition/Business Understanding:**
    * Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve or the question you are trying to answer.
    * Understand the business context and objectives.
    * Identify the required outcomes and metrics.

2.  **Data Acquisition:**
    * Gather data from relevant sources (databases, APIs, files, etc.).
    * Ensure data quality and integrity.
    * Document data sources and acquisition methods.

3.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    * Handle missing values (imputation, deletion).
    * Correct data inconsistencies and errors.
    * Remove duplicate records.
    * Transform data into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., data type conversions).
    * Handle outliers.
    * Perform feature engineering.

4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Understand the data's structure and characteristics.
    * Identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
    * Generate hypotheses.
    * Visualize data to gain insights.

5.  **Modeling and Analysis:**
    * Select appropriate statistical or machine learning models.
    * Train and evaluate models.
    * Perform statistical tests and hypothesis testing.
    * Fine tune models.

6.  **Interpretation and Communication:**
    * Interpret the results of the analysis.
    * Draw meaningful conclusions.
    * Communicate findings effectively through reports, visualizations, and presentations.
    * Deploy models if needed.

7.  **Evaluation and Iteration:**
    * Evaluate the effectiveness of the analysis and model.
    * Iterate on the process to improve results.
    * Monitor model performance over time.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves summarizing and visualizing data to gain a better understanding of its underlying structure and characteristics.
